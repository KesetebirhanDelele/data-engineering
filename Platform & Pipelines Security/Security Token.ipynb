    "# Security Token\n",
    "In the context of network security, a \"security token\" typically refers to a small hardware or software-based device that is used to provide an additional layer of authentication and security for accessing a network, system, or online service. \n",
    "\n",
    "Security tokens are a type of __two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanism__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __primary purpose of using security tokens__ is to enhance security by requiring users to present something they possess (the token) in addition to something they know (such as a password) to gain access. This makes it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access to sensitive information or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of security tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Security Tokens: \n",
    "These physical devices are small, portable, and often resemble a key fob or USB stick. They generate one-time passwords (OTPs) or use public-key infrastructure (PKI) to create digital signatures for authentication. To log in to a network or system, the user must enter the current OTP from the token, along with their regular username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Security Tokens: \n",
    "These tokens are typically applications or software-based solutions that run on a user's smartphone, tablet, or computer. They generate OTPs or use other cryptographic methods for authentication. Users need to enter the OTP from the software token when prompted during the login process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security tokens add an extra layer of protection to traditional username/password authentication because even if someone steals or guesses a user's password, they still cannot gain access without the physical token or software token application. This helps prevent various types of cyber attacks, including phishing, password brute-forcing, and credential theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that security tokens are not foolproof, and their effectiveness can be influenced by various factors, including token implementation, user behavior, and the overall security practices of the organization. However, when used properly in combination with other security measures, security tokens can significantly improve the overall security posture of a network or system."
