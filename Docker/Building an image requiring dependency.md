# Building an image needing dependency

## 1. Create a Python file containing faker library in src
> This library will generate a fake name and state every time it is run. Note that faker library is not found in Python and needs to be imported 
## 2. Create a Dockerfile
> Make sure a dockerfile containing the following content is placed in the working folder (Docker-Fundamentals):

### Base image
> FROM python:3.9

### Copy requirements.text into temp file to show what library to import
> COPY requirements.txt /tmp/

### Update Python base image and install requirements from the text file
> RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pip && \
>     pip install --requirement /tmp/requirements.txt

### Copies python code file from src folder by going back a level and going in src folder
> copy ./src/hello-faked-person.py /src/hello-faked-person.py

### ENTRYPOINT informs docker what is going to happen when the container is up and running: run python code using the hello-faked-person file
> ENTRYPOINT ["python","./src/hello-faked-person.py"]

## 3. Checking if there is an active container which is running
PS C:\Users\keset>
>__docker ps__


CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND        CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                                                    NAMES

## 4. Moving to the folder where the python code is located 
__PS C:\Users\keset> cd OneDrive\Desktop\projects\data-engineering\Docker\Docker-Fundamentals__

## 5. Biulding the Docker image
PS C:\Users\keset\OneDrive\Desktop\projects\data-engineering\Docker\Docker-Fundamentals> 
> __docker build -f dockerfile-user -t hello-user .__
