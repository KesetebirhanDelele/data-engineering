    "# Use Docker Compose\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications. With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big advantage of using Compose is you can define your application stack in a file, keep it at the root of your project repo (it’s now version controlled), and easily enable someone else to contribute to your project. Someone would only need to clone your repo and start the compose app. In fact, you might see quite a few projects on GitHub/GitLab doing exactly this now.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Docker Compose\n",
    "If you installed Docker Desktop for Windows, Mac, or Linux you already have Docker Compose! Play-with-Docker instances already have Docker Compose installed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standalone installations of Docker Engine requires Docker Compose to be installed as a separate package, see Install the Compose plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you should be able to run the following and see version information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker compose version\n",
    "Create the Compose file\n",
    "At the root of the /getting-started/app folder or where ever you want create and keep a file named docker-compose.yml.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the sample in the Docker-compose.yml file in the Docker folder in this vscode.\n",
