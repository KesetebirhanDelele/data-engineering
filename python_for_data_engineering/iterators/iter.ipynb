    "# Iterators and Iterables\n",
    "Iterators and iterables are concepts closely related to looping in Python. While they may sound similar, understanding the difference between them is essential. I think of an iterable as anything that can be looped over, such as lists, strings, or even files. On the other hand, an iterator is an object that generates the next value in the iteration sequence.\n",
