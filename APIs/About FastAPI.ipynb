    "# Application of FastAPI in Data Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is primarily known as a high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. Data engineers can leverage FastAPI to create robust and efficient API endpoints for handling data-related tasks. Here are some of the different things that data engineers can do with FastAPI:"

   "source": [
    "1. Data Ingestion: FastAPI can be used to create API endpoints that accept data from various sources, such as CSV files, JSON payloads, or data streams. Data engineers can define the API routes to handle incoming data and process it for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Transformation: FastAPI can be employed to build API endpoints that transform data. Data engineers can define data processing logic to clean, filter, aggregate, or otherwise manipulate data before storing it or passing it to other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Validation: FastAPI provides powerful validation capabilities to ensure that the incoming data meets the required criteria. Data engineers can define validation rules to check data integrity and correctness before processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Storage and Retrieval: FastAPI can interact with databases and other storage systems. Data engineers can create endpoints to store data in databases (e.g., SQL databases, NoSQL databases) or retrieve data from them based on client requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Real-time Data Streaming: FastAPI can handle real-time data streaming scenarios. Data engineers can create WebSocket endpoints to establish bidirectional communication between clients and servers, facilitating real-time data updates and notifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data Serialization: FastAPI automatically serializes Python objects to JSON, making it easy for data engineers to return structured data from API endpoints. This is particularly useful when the API serves as an interface for other applications or systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Data Integration: FastAPI can be used to build API endpoints that integrate with external services or APIs. Data engineers can create endpoints that fetch data from third-party APIs, process it, and provide the results to clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Data Analysis and Reporting: FastAPI can be used to build endpoints for generating reports and conducting data analysis tasks. Data engineers can define routes that take input parameters, process data, and return meaningful insights or reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Scheduled Data Jobs: While FastAPI is primarily a web framework, data engineers can deploy FastAPI-based applications to run scheduled data jobs. These jobs can perform tasks like data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) operations on a predefined schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to note that the primary purpose of FastAPI is to create web APIs efficiently, so data engineers may still need to integrate FastAPI with other tools and libraries to cover the full range of data engineering tasks effectively. Additionally, newer updates or third-party extensions might have expanded FastAPI's capabilities beyond the scope mentioned here, so I recommend checking the latest documentation and community resources for up-to-date information."
